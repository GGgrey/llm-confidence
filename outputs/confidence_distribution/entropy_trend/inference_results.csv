"To find the vertical asymptotes of a rational function in the form y = p(x)/q(x), we need to look for values of x that make the denominator q(x) equal to zero. 

For the given function y = 2 / (x^2 + x - 6), the denominator is x^2 + x - 6.

First, let's find the values of x that make the denominator equal to zero:

x^2 + x - 6 = 0

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.

In this case, a = 1, b = 1, and c = -6. 

x = (-(1) ± √((1)^2 - 4(1)(-6))) / (2(1))
x = (-1 ± √(1 + 24)) / 2
x = (-1 ± √25) / 2
x = (-1 ± 5) / 2

So, we have two possible values for x:
x = (-1 + 5) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2
x = (-1 - 5) / 2 = -6 / 2 = -3

Now, let's check if these values are vertical asymptotes by plugging them into the original function:

For x = 2:
y = 2 / ((2)^2 + 2 - 6) = 2 / (4 + 2 - 6) = 2 / 0 (this is undefined, so x = 2 is a vertical asymptote)

For x = -3:
y = 2 / ((-3)^2 + (-3) - 6) = 2 / (9 - 3 - 6) = 2 / 0 (this is undefined, so x = -3 is a vertical asymptote)

Therefore, the graph of y = 2 / (x^2 + x - 6) has 2 vertical asymptotes.

"To find the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence, we need to identify the common difference and the first term.

The common difference is the difference between each consecutive term. In this case, the common difference is 4 (10 - 6 = 4, 14 - 10 = 4, 18 - 14 = 4).

The formula to find the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:

where a1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference.

In this case, a1 = 6 and d = 4. 

We need to find the 100th term, so n = 100. 

Now, let's plug in the values into the formula:
a100 = 6 + (100 - 1) * 4
a100 = 6 + (99) * 4
a100 = 6 + 396

"To determine the vertical asymptotes of the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$, we need to find the values of $x$ where the denominator of the fraction becomes zero, as division by zero is undefined.

The denominator of the fraction can be factored as:
$x^2+x-6 = (x+3)(x-2)$

Now, we set the denominator equal to zero to find the values of $x$ where the function is undefined:
$(x+3)(x-2) = 0$

This can be solved by setting each factor equal to zero and solving for $x$:
$x+3 = 0 \implies x = -3$
$x-2 = 0 \implies x = 2$

Therefore, the function $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ has vertical asymptotes at $x=-3$ and $x=2$.

"To find the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence, we need to find the common difference (d) and the first term (a1).

Step 1: Find the common difference (d)
The given sequence is an arithmetic sequence, and we can find the common difference by subtracting any term from the previous term. 

d = 10 - 6 = 4

However, since 4 is the result of subtracting the first term from the second term, the common difference is likely the same between any two consecutive terms. 

Step 2: Verify the common difference
We can verify the common difference by checking it between any two other terms:

10 - 8 is not present but we can try 14 - 10 = 4

Therefore, our common difference is indeed 4.

Step 3: Find the formula for the nth term
The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by: an = a1 + (n-1)d

Step 4: Find the 100th term

x^2 + x - 6 = 0

Step 1: Identify the first term (a) and the common difference (d).

"To find the vertical asymptotes of a rational function, we need to find the values of x that make the denominator equal to zero and not cancel out with any factors in the numerator.

Given the equation $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$, we first need to factor the denominator. 

The denominator is a quadratic expression, which can be factored as $x^2 + x - 6 = (x+3)(x-2)$.

Now, let's set the denominator equal to zero and solve for x: $(x+3)(x-2) = 0$. 

We find the values of x that satisfy this equation by setting each factor equal to zero. 

Setting $x+3 = 0$ gives us $x = -3$.
Setting $x-2 = 0$ gives us $x = 2$.

However, we need to check if these values of x make the numerator equal to zero. 

For $x = -3$, substituting into the numerator gives $2$, which is not zero.
For $x = 2$, substituting into the numerator gives $2$, which is not zero.

Therefore, both $x = -3$ and $x = 2$ make the denominator zero and do not make the numerator zero.

So, the function has two vertical asymptotes at $x = -3$ and $x = 2$.

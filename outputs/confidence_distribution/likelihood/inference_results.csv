"To find the vertical asymptotes of the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$, we need to find the values of x for which the denominator of the fraction becomes zero.

First, let's factor the denominator:
$x^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2)$

Now we have:
$y = \frac{2}{(x + 3)(x - 2)}$

To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to find the values of x that make the denominator zero:
$(x + 3) = 0$ or $(x - 2) = 0$

Solving for x in both cases, we get:
$x + 3 = 0$ implies $x = -3$
$x - 2 = 0$ implies $x = 2$

However, there's a catch. If the degree of the numerator and denominator are the same and they share a common factor, there will be a hole at the shared factor's root instead of a vertical asymptote.

In this case, since both the numerator and denominator have a degree of zero, we have a hole at the shared factor's root.

Thus, the shared factor is (x + 1) from the numerator.

The denominator and numerator have no common factors other than 1, and so, the points x = -3 and x = 2 are vertical asymptotes of the graph.

Therefore, there are 2 vertical asymptotes.

$130\%$ of 20 = 20 * 1.3 = 26.

"To find the vertical asymptotes of a rational function like y = 2/(x^2 + x - 6), we need to find the values of x that make the denominator zero. 

Step 1: Factor the denominator:

Step 2: Set the denominator equal to zero and solve for x:
(x + 3)(x - 2) = 0
x + 3 = 0 or x - 2 = 0
x = -3 or x = 2

These are the values that make the denominator zero. However, to be a vertical asymptote, there must be a factor in the numerator that cancels out the factor in the denominator that is causing the denominator to be zero.

Step 3: Check if there is a factor in the numerator that cancels out (x + 3) and (x - 2):
The numerator is just a constant 2, which does not have any factors.

Since there are no factors in the numerator to cancel out (x + 3) and (x - 2), there will be vertical asymptotes at x = -3 and x = 2.

However, since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, there will only be vertical asymptotes, and there won't be holes in the graph.

"To find the 100th term of the arithmetic sequence, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the common difference (d) of the sequence.
   The common difference is the difference between each consecutive term.

2. Find the first term (a1) of the sequence.
   The first term is already given as a1 = 6.

3. Use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:
   an = a1 + (n - 1) * d, where an is the nth term, a1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference.

"To find vertical asymptotes, we need to find the values of x that make the denominator of the fraction zero. 

Step 1: Find the factors of the denominator, $x^2 + x - 6$.
The factors are $(x-2)$ and $(x+3)$.

Step 2: Set the factors equal to zero to find the values of x that make the denominator zero.
$(x-2) = 0$ and $(x+3) = 0$
Solving for x gives $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.

Step 3: Check if the numerator has any factors that cancel out with the denominator.
The numerator is $2$. Neither $x = 2$ nor $x = -3$ will make the numerator zero.

Since the denominator is a quadratic expression with no factors cancelling out with the numerator, and there are no values of x where the denominator is zero, we will count the number of real values where the denominator is zero to find the number of vertical asymptotes.

There are two values of x where the denominator is zero: $x = 2$ and $x = -3$. Since these values make the denominator zero, they are the vertical asymptotes.
